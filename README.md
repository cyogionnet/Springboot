Following are the software required to be installed on the local machine for POC to work properly

1) Cassandra version 2.1.15

2) Redis

3) Elastic search

4) Log stash

6) Use STS IDE or install STS plugin to eclipse

Cassandra

Following are the steps required

1) Start cassandra 

2) From the bin directory start cqlsh

3) From cqlsh run the following commands

CREATE KEYSPACE verizon WITH REPLICATION = { 'class' : 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 3 };

use verizon;

create table techSpec (id int, product text, title text, imageUrl text, techSpecFlag text, detailText text, primary key (id, product));

create index on techSpec(product);

insert into techSpec (id, product, title, techSpecFlag, detailText) values (1, 'dev3240009','Stand by time', 'true', '24 hrs');

insert into techSpec (id, product, title, techSpecFlag, detailText) values (2, 'dev3240009','Camera', 'true', '8 MP');

insert into techSpec (id, product, title, techSpecFlag, detailText) values (3, 'dev3240009','Weight', 'true', '6.07');

insert into techSpec (id, product, title, techSpecFlag, detailText) values (4, 'dev3240009','Storage', 'true', '16 GB, 64 GB, or 128 GB');

create table deviceFeature( id int, product text, imageUrl text, detailedText text, styleName text, title text, disclouserText text, smallImage text, imageOrVideUrl text, primary key (id, product));

create index on deviceFeature(product);

insert into deviceFeature(id, product, detailedText, title, smallImage, imageOrVideUrl) values (1, 'dev3240009', 'With innovations that deliver high contrast, dual domain pixedl for more acurate color','5.5 inch Retina HD display','https://mobile.vzw.com/hybridClient/is/image/', 'https://mobile.vzw.com/hybridClient/is/image/');

Redis

1) Start redis server using command redid-server

Elastic Search

1) Start Elastic search using command elastic search

Logstash

1) Start log stash using command logstash -f logstash.conf

2) In logstash.conf file make sure the path of the application.log is pointing to correct location. Currently it contains the path on my mac machine.Make sure you provide the absolute path

Kibana

1) Start cabana using the command cabana

Importing project

1) Import project into IDE as Maven project.

2) In application.properties files under config-server project change the path to point to the git location on your local system

3) Two properties file would be required catalog.properties, device.properties, test.properties and vision.properties. The file would contain configuration information required by other projects and would be loaded by central config server.

4) Following is the content of each property file, make sure these files are committed to git.(Create a new folder and initialize it as git repository. Add the 2 files to git repository and then commit it to git. You donâ€™t have to push it to remote server)

Catalog.properties

cassandra.contactpoints=localhost

cassandra.port=9042

cassandra.keyspace=verizon

vision.properties
vision_url=http://localhost:7777/test/dummy

5) If you have STS installed or STS plugin in eclipse you can start the servers from Boot Dashboard view. To get Boot Dashboard view from the Window menu of the IDE click on Show view and search for Boot Dashboard.

6) Start the config-server first followed by service-registry server, then you can start the remaining servers in any order
